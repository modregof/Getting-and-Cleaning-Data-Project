# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Description

This repo contains my course project to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) ["Getting And Cleaning Data"](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-011) course that is part of Data Science specialization.

There is just one script called `run_analysis.R`. It contains all code to do the following:

 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The Code is explained in more detail in CodeBook.md

## Run the code

1. Download the files in your working directory from (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Run the script `run_analysis.R` from RStudio:
3. Look for the final dataset at `data/output/uci_har_mean_std_averages.csv`
